     * ACTION_PACKAGE_REPLACED isn't taken into account anymore. This is because when
     * android replaces a package, it removes the old one (ACTION_PACKAGE_ADDED is fired),
     * then adds the new one (ACTION_PACKAGE_ADDED is also fired) and only then is the
     * ACTION_PACKAGE_REPLACED intent sent.
     * If this is a replacement, this method can detect it based on the first two intents
     * so there is no need to wait for the third one.
     *
     * @param i The Intent to process.
